# URL Router
A wrapper for easily routing URL on Android

## Examples

### Initialization

```kotlin
/* 
 * Mapping the schema and host
 */
 
Router.INSTANCE.preMap("*://<subdomain:[a-z]+>.mysite.com/*", {
    val subdomain = it.variables.getString("subdomain")
    if (subdomain == "blog") {
        // Launch intent
        ...
        null // Don't continue to path routing below by returning null
    } else {
        Uri.parse(it.url).path // Continue to path routing below
    }
})

/* 
 * Mapping the path
 */

/* Simple mapping */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/about", {
    ...
})

/* Wildcard at the end for any characters until end of url */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/promo/*", {
    ...
})

/* Wildcard in segment for any character in specific segment */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/promo/*/discounted", {
    ...
})

/* Get value from parsed queries */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/register", {
    val referrer = it.queries.getString("referrer")
    ...
})

/* Get value from parsed variables in segment of path */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/transaction/<transaction_id>/view", {
    val transactionId = it.variables.getLong("transaction_id")
    ...
})

/* Get value from parsed variables in subsegment of segment */

Router.INSTANCE.map("/product/<product_id:[a-z0-9]+>-*", {
    val productId = it.variables.getString("product_id")
    ...
})
```

### Usage

```kotlin
Router.INSTANCE.route(context, url, optionalArgs)
```

### Multiple Instances

```kotlin
val loginUserRouter = Router()
val nonloginUserRouter = Router()
```

### Language

#### Wildcard : `*`
- Can be placed anywhere except query
- Used for replacing any character inside URL
- Regex: `.+` -> Any character more than 1

#### Variable Name : `<variable_name>`
- Can be placed anywhere except query
- Used for getting value inside URL
- Variable name can only use `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`
- Default regex: `[^/]+` -> Any character more than 1 except `/`
- Default regex can be changed

#### Variable Name With Specific Pattern : `<variable_name:[a-z0-9]+>`
- Can be placed anywhere except query
- Used for getting value inside URL
- Variable name can only use `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`
- Default regex: `[^/]+` -> Any character more than 1 except `/`
- Default regex can be changed
- Variable name and regex separated with `:`
- Specific regex overrides default regex
